# ScavengerHunt

### About

I was the project lead of this scavenger hunt game in my creative media applications class. In this treasure hunt game, you are a ghost of Paul Laurence Dunbar and are trying to collect objects that were once important to you inside of your house. This includes the following objects:

- Poem
- Top Hat
- Picture
- Wedding Ring
- Plate
- Spade

When you collect five objects, your ghost is satisfied and you win!

### Final Implementations Include:

- A constant score overlay
- A final screen overlay lets the player know that the game is over
- Background music
- Fixed and added animations
- Added hidden objects
- Added background objects
- Fixed texture issues
- Camera follows the player (must be played in camera view!)
- Planes added to add boundaries

### How to Play:

1. Enter camera view (num pad 0)
2. Select 3D full view and fill the camera to the screen
3. Press P to start the game
4. Collect 5 hidden objects (Must collide with the object and press e; some items are added to throw you off! Interacting them may begin an animation or will not have any value.)
5. You win!
